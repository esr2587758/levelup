AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor have access to a shell. They can run any CLI tool you give them. But after months of building agent workflows — starting with MCP servers, ripping them out, replacing them with CLIs, then redesigning those CLIs — I've learned that most CLI tools are subtly hostile to AI agents.

This guide distills hard-won lessons from real agent workflows into practical rules for building CLI tools that agents can use effectively.

## Why CLI Over MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the "right" way to give agents structured tool access. But in practice, I kept arriving at the same conclusion: if your agent has shell access, a well-designed CLI often wins.

Here's why I deleted three MCP servers in favor of direct CLI usage:

**Token cost.** There is an ambient token cost to MCP: tool definitions (descriptions, parameters, JSON schemas) must be persistently loaded into the agent's system prompt, constantly eating into your context window before the tool is even used. Furthermore, every invocation includes JSON-RPC framing and response envelopes. A CLI call, by contrast, is just a bash command and its stdout—it only consumes tokens when actively used. For a simple file conversion, switching from an MCP server to a CLI tool cut token usage by roughly 40%.

**Zero indirection.** When I built an MCP server for Gitea, then realized the agent could just run tea (the Gitea CLI) directly, the MCP server was pure overhead. The agent already knows how to read --help, parse output, and handle errors. That's what it does all day.

**Reliability.** MCP servers crash, lose connections, and have startup latency. A CLI binary is stateless and always available. When my MCP tools became unreliable mid-session, the fallback was always the same: "try using the CLI."

## When MCP Still Wins

MCP is the better choice when you're exposing 50+ tools behind a single server (like GitLab's API surface), need stateful sessions across calls, require dynamic tool discovery at scale, or are building multi-agent architectures where protocol-level composition matters.

**Managing MCP Token Bloat:** If you do build an MCP server, you must actively defend the agent's context window. Instead of returning raw, unpaginated JSON (which can easily blow past 25k tokens) or exposing hundreds of tools at once, build "ergonomic" tools:

- **Progressive Disclosure:** To solve the ambient cost of tool definitions eating the context window, don't expose 100 tools upfront. Instead, expose a single "tool search" or "discovery" tool that allows the agent to dynamically load the specific tool schemas it needs for the current task (see Anthropic's "Tool Search Tool" pattern for a great example).
- **Pagination and Filtering:** Never return all records. Force the agent to query exactly what it needs.
- **Semantic Truncation:** If an agent asks to read a 10,000-line log file, the server should return the most relevant snippets, or truncate and instruct the agent to use grep.
- **Programmatic Orchestration:** Let agents combine tools locally within the server, so only the final summarized result is returned to the context window, skipping the intermediate steps.

The rule of thumb: if a human would use a CLI for it, the agent should too.

## The Eight Rules

### 1. Structured Output Is Not Optional

The single most important thing you can do is support `--json` or `--output json`.

```
# Bad: agent has to parse this
$ myctl list pods
NAME          STATUS    AGE
web-1         Running   3d
worker-2      Failed    1h

# Good: agent gets clean data
$ myctl list pods --json
[
  {"name": "web-1", "status": "Running", "age_seconds": 259200},
  {"name": "worker-2", "status": "Failed", "age_seconds": 3600}
]
```

Agents are good at parsing text, but "good" isn't "reliable." A table that wraps differently depending on terminal width, or a status field that sometimes says "Running" and sometimes "running" — these cause silent failures in agent workflows.

Rules for structured output:

- **JSON to stdout, everything else to stderr.** Progress messages, warnings, spinners — all stderr. Stdout is your API contract.
- **Flat over nested.** `{"pod_name": "web-1", "pod_status": "Running"}` is easier for an agent to work with than `{"pod": {"metadata": {"name": "web-1"}, "status": {"phase": "Running"}}}`.
- **Consistent types.** If age is a number in one command, don't make it a string like "3 days" in another. Use seconds or ISO 8601 timestamps.
- **JSON Lines for streaming.** If the command produces incremental output, emit one JSON object per line. Agents handle JSONL well.

### 2. Exit Codes Are the Agent's Control Flow

Agents check `$?` to decide what to do next. A tool that returns 0 on failure breaks every agent workflow that depends on it.

```
# This is a contract:
0   = success
1   = general failure
2   = usage error (bad arguments)
3   = resource not found
4   = permission denied
5   = conflict (resource already exists)
```

Document your exit codes. An agent that gets exit code 5 can decide to skip creation and move to the next step. An agent that gets exit code 1 for everything has to parse stderr to figure out what happened — and it will sometimes get it wrong.

Combine exit codes with structured error output:

```
$ myctl create thing --name duplicate-name
# stderr: Error: resource "duplicate-name" already exists
# stdout (with --json): {"error": "conflict", "message": "resource 'duplicate-name' already exists", "existing_id": "abc123"}
# exit code: 5
```

### 3. Make Commands Idempotent

Agents retry. Networks fail. Commands get interrupted. If your create command fails on the second run because the resource already exists, the agent has to write special-case retry logic.

```
# Fragile: fails on retry
$ myctl create namespace prod
Error: namespace "prod" already exists

# Robust: idempotent
$ myctl ensure namespace prod
namespace "prod" already exists (no changes)

# Or use a flag
$ myctl create namespace prod --if-not-exists
```

The kubectl model is a good reference: `kubectl apply` is idempotent by design. Declarative commands (ensure, apply, sync) are inherently safer for agents than imperative ones (create, delete).

If you can't make a command idempotent, make the conflict detectable. Return a distinct exit code (like 5 for "already exists") so the agent can handle it programmatically.

### 4. Self-Documenting Beats External Docs

When an agent encounters an unfamiliar CLI, the first thing it does is run `--help`. That help text is your tool description, your parameter spec, and your usage guide all in one.

```
# Bad: minimal help
$ myctl deploy --help
Usage: myctl deploy [flags]

# Good: the agent can learn from this
$ myctl deploy --help
Deploy a service to the target environment.

Usage:
  myctl deploy <service-name> --env <environment> [flags]

Arguments:
  service-name    Name of the service to deploy (required)

Flags:
  --env string       Target environment: dev, staging, prod (required)
  --image string     Container image override (default: from config)
  --dry-run          Preview changes without applying
  --wait             Wait for deployment to complete (default: true)
  --timeout duration Maximum wait time (default: 5m)
  --json             Output result as JSON

Examples:
  myctl deploy web-api --env staging
  myctl deploy web-api --env prod --image myregistry/web:v2.1.0 --json
  myctl deploy web-api --env dev --dry-run
```

Key points:

- **Show required vs optional clearly.** Agents will not guess which flags are required.
- **Include realistic examples.** Agents learn patterns from examples faster than from flag descriptions.
- **Document the --json flag.** If the agent doesn't know it exists, it won't use it.
- **Use subcommand discovery.** `myctl --help` should list all subcommands. `myctl deploy --help` should give full detail.

### 5. Design for Composability

Unix philosophy applies doubly for agents. Agents already think in pipelines — they chain commands naturally.

```
# An agent will naturally compose these:
myctl list pods --json | jq '.[] | select(.status == "Failed") | .name'

# Better: build filtering in
myctl list pods --status failed --json --field name

# Best: support both approaches
myctl list pods --status failed --json        # filtered JSON
myctl list pods --status failed --quiet       # just names, one per line
```

Design your CLI so that:

- **`--quiet` or `-q` outputs bare values.** One value per line, no headers, no decoration. Agents use this for piping into xargs or while read.
- **Stdin acceptance is explicit.** If a command can read from stdin, document it: `myctl apply -f -` reads from stdin. Don't make the agent guess.
- **Batch operations exist.** If an agent needs to delete 50 resources, `myctl delete --selector app=old` is one call instead of 50.

### 6. Provide Dry-Run and Confirmation Bypass

Agents need two things that conflict with interactive CLI design: they need to preview destructive actions, and they need to execute without human confirmation prompts.

```
# Preview what would happen
$ myctl deploy web-api --env prod --dry-run --json
{
  "action": "deploy",
  "changes": [
    {"type": "update", "resource": "deployment/web-api", "diff": "image: v2.0 → v2.1"}
  ],
  "warnings": ["This will restart 3 running pods"]
}

# Execute without interactive prompt
$ myctl deploy web-api --env prod --yes
# or
$ myctl deploy web-api --env prod --force
```

Rules:

- **`--dry-run` should produce structured output.** Not "would deploy web-api to prod" but a JSON diff of what changes.
- **`--yes` / `--no-confirm` / `--force` bypasses all prompts.** An agent cannot type "y" at a confirmation prompt. If your CLI hangs waiting for input, the agent's workflow is dead.
- **Detect non-interactive terminals.** If stdin is not a TTY, either skip prompts automatically or fail with a clear error telling the user to pass `--yes`.

### 7. Errors Should Be Actionable

When a command fails, the agent needs to decide: retry, try something else, or give up. The error message determines which.

```
# Bad: the agent has no idea what to do
$ myctl deploy web-api --env prod
Error: deployment failed

# Good: the agent can reason about this
$ myctl deploy web-api --env prod --json
# exit code: 1
# stderr: Error: image "myregistry/web:v2.1.0" not found in registry
# stdout: {"error": "image_not_found", "image": "myregistry/web:v2.1.0",
#          "registry": "myregistry", "suggestion": "check image tag exists"}
```

Error design for agents:

- **Error codes/types in structured output.** A string like `"image_not_found"` is parseable. `"Error occurred"` is not.
- **Include the failing input.** If the image name is wrong, echo it back. The agent needs this to construct a fix.
- **Suggest next steps when possible.** `"suggestion": "run myctl images list to see available tags"` gives the agent a concrete recovery path.
- **Separate transient from permanent errors.** A timeout is worth retrying. A permission denied is not. If your exit codes or error types distinguish these, the agent can build appropriate retry logic.

### 8. Use Consistent Noun-Verb Grammar

When designing a CLI with many subcommands, order matters. Human users might memorize random command names, but agents rely on predictable patterns to discover what a tool can do.

```
# Bad: Mixed grammar is hard to guess
$ myctl create-user
$ myctl delete_user
$ myctl user-group add

# Good: Noun -> Verb hierarchy
$ myctl user create
$ myctl user delete
$ myctl user group add
```

The noun verb pattern (e.g., `docker container ls`, `gh pr create`) is exceptionally agent-friendly because it naturally groups related actions in the `--help` output. When an agent runs `myctl --help`, it sees a list of resources (nouns). When it runs `myctl user --help`, it sees all possible actions (verbs) for that resource. This hierarchical structure turns exploration into a deterministic tree search, rather than a guessing game.

## Quick Reference Checklist

When building a CLI tool that agents will use:

- [ ] `--json` flag for structured output
- [ ] JSON to stdout, messages to stderr
- [ ] Meaningful exit codes (not just 0/1)
- [ ] Idempotent operations (or clear conflict handling)
- [ ] Comprehensive `--help` with examples
- [ ] `--dry-run` for destructive commands
- [ ] `--yes`/`--force` to bypass prompts
- [ ] `--quiet` for pipe-friendly bare output
- [ ] Consistent field names and types across commands
- [ ] Consistent noun-verb hierarchy (e.g., `noun verb`)
- [ ] Actionable error messages with error codes
- [ ] Batch operations for bulk work
- [ ] Non-interactive TTY detection

## The MCP-to-CLI Decision Framework

Use this when deciding whether to build an MCP server or a CLI:

| Factor | Choose CLI | Choose MCP |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Number of operations | < 15 commands | 50+ tools |
| State between calls | Stateless | Stateful sessions needed |
| Agent has shell access | Yes | No (API-only) |
| Token budget matters | Yes | Less constrained |
| Existing CLI exists | Wrap or use directly | Build MCP server |
| Multi-agent system | Single agent | Protocol composition |
| Reliability requirement | High (no server to crash) | Acceptable server dependency |

The best agent tooling often starts as an MCP server and migrates to a CLI once you understand the actual usage patterns — or starts as a CLI and stays there because it was good enough all along.

This guide is based on patterns that emerged from building agent workflows across infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, and developer tooling. The examples are drawn from real production decisions where MCP servers were built, evaluated, and in several cases replaced with CLI tools that agents could use more effectively.
